# Pneumonia Classication Using Chest Xray

Note: This repository is currently under developemnt

## What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 5863 images for chest xrays. It is available on [Mendely](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Model
To classify normal vs pneumonia patients, a CNN was trained using the dataset. The model was created using Tensorflow.
